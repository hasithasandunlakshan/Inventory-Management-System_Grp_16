# Database Changes Not Visible in Frontend - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Summary

Database changes are not reflected in the frontend despite being connected to the correct database.

## Potential Causes & Solutions Applied

### 1. Browser/HTTP Caching Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Browser or HTTP caching preventing fresh data retrieval
**Solutions Applied**:

- Added cache-busting headers to frontend requests (`Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`)
- Added timestamp parameters to API calls to prevent URL-based caching
- Modified request options to use `cache: 'no-store'` for GET requests
- Added cache-control headers to backend API responses

### 2. Frontend Data Fetching Issues ✅ IMPROVED

**Problem**: Frontend not properly refreshing data
**Solutions Applied**:

- Replaced page reload with proper data refresh function
- Added auto-refresh mechanism (every 30 seconds)
- Added manual refresh button with loading states
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging data flow

### 3. Backend Response Caching ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Backend responses being cached
**Solutions Applied**:

- Added cache-control headers to Order Controller responses
- Added timestamp logging in backend for debugging
- Enhanced response headers with anti-caching directives

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes:

1. **src/lib/utils/authUtils.ts**

   - Added cache-busting headers to all authenticated requests
   - Added `X-Requested-At` timestamp header
   - Set `cache: 'no-store'` for GET requests

2. **src/lib/services/orderService.ts**

   - Added timestamp parameter to API URLs
   - Enhanced logging with response headers
   - Added `fetchedAt` timestamp to responses

3. **src/app/logistics/shipping/page.tsx**
   - Refactored data fetching into reusable function
   - Added auto-refresh mechanism (30-second interval)
   - Improved manual refresh button functionality
   - Enhanced error handling and loading states

### Backend Changes:

1. **OrderController.java**
   - Added anti-caching headers to `/all` endpoint responses
   - Added timestamp logging for debugging
   - Enhanced error responses with cache-control headers

## Additional Diagnostic Tools

### Debug Tool Created:

- **debug-cache-issue.html**: Browser-based debugging tool to test:
  - Direct API calls
  - Cache-busting mechanisms
  - Frontend service integration
  - Authentication token validation
  - Browser cache clearing

## Testing the Solution

### 1. Using the Debug Tool:

```bash
# Open the debug tool in your browser
open /Users/gayathriharshila/train-passenger-counter/Inventory-Management-System_Grp_16/debug-cache-issue.html
```

### 2. Manual Testing Steps:

1. Make a change in the database
2. Wait for auto-refresh (30 seconds) OR click "Refresh Orders" button
3. Check browser console for fresh data logs
4. Verify timestamp changes in console logs

### 3. Verification Points:

- Console logs should show new timestamps for each request
- Response headers should include cache-control directives
- Orders should reflect database changes immediately after refresh

## Common Issues Still to Check

### 1. Database Connection Issues

- Verify backend is connected to the correct database
- Check database connection logs
- Confirm database changes are actually being saved

### 2. Authentication Issues

- Ensure auth token is valid and not expired
- Check if user has proper permissions
- Verify JWT token contains correct user information

### 3. Network/Proxy Issues

- Check if there's a proxy or CDN caching responses
- Verify no network-level caching is occurring
- Check for any middleware that might cache responses

### 4. Service Restart Required

If changes still aren't visible:

1. Restart the Order Service: `cd backend/Orderservice && mvn spring-boot:run`
2. Restart the API Gateway: `cd backend/ApiGateway && mvn spring-boot:run`
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Hard refresh the frontend (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

## Next Steps for Further Debugging

1. **Check Backend Logs**: Look for database queries and connection issues
2. **Database Verification**: Connect directly to database and verify changes
3. **API Testing**: Use the debug tool to test different scenarios
4. **Network Analysis**: Use browser dev tools to inspect network requests
5. **Service Health**: Verify all microservices are running and healthy

## Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Restart Order Service
cd backend/Orderservice
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

# Restart API Gateway
cd backend/ApiGateway
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

# Restart Frontend
cd frontend/inventory-management-system
npm run dev
```

The implemented solutions should resolve most caching-related issues. If problems persist, the issue is likely at the database or service level rather than caching.
