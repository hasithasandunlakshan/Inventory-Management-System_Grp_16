## üìç Section 3.1.4 - UI and E2E Testing (UPDATE)

### Technique

Automated E2E test cases are executed using **Selenium WebDriver (Java bindings)** and **Playwright (TypeScript bindings)**. Tests are organized using the **Page Object Model (POM)** to simulate realistic user actions (typing, clicking, submitting forms). This process validates the correct rendering of dynamically loaded data and confirms that the correct actions occur when UI elements are interacted with.

**Selenium WebDriver** provides comprehensive Java-based testing with robust cross-browser support and mature ecosystem integration, while **Playwright** offers modern, fast execution with built-in auto-waiting, powerful debugging tools (trace viewer, UI mode), and native support for modern web features including API mocking and network interception.

## üìç Target Test Items

This section identifies the major software components, supporting elements, third-party libraries, and system environments that will be targeted for testing in the Inventory Management System. The goal is to ensure that every critical module and supporting service operates correctly, reliably, and securely across different environments and user roles.

### Software Components

The complete web-based platform, including frontend and backend functionalities. The system covers multiple workflows such as:

- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products with image upload, category management, stock tracking, and barcode support
- **Order Management**: Complete order lifecycle management, customer tracking, payment processing, and order status updates
- **Inventory Management**: Stock level monitoring, movement tracking, low stock alerts, and category-based inventory analytics
- **Supplier Management**: Supplier profiles, performance tracking, purchase orders, and delivery log management
- **User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control**: JWT-based authentication with five distinct roles (ADMIN, MANAGER, STORE KEEPER, USER, SUPPLIER)
- **Dashboard and Analytics**: Real-time metrics, interactive charts (bar, line, pie, donut), revenue tracking, and role-specific dashboard views
- **Real-Time Notifications**: WebSocket-based notifications for order events, inventory alerts, and system updates
- **ML-Based Demand Forecasting**: Predictive analytics for inventory planning using machine learning algorithms

### Supporting Product Elements

**API Endpoints:**
- Backend microservices developed using **Spring Boot 3** and **Java 17** that handle requests and responses related to:
