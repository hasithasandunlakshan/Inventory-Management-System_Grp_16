# CI/CD Health Check Fix

## Problem Identified ‚ùå

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing at the health check step because **Spring Boot Actuator** was not included in your project. The workflow was trying to access `/actuator/health`, but this endpoint didn't exist.

**Error:**
```
‚è≥ Attempt 1/30 - Service not ready yet, waiting...
‚è≥ Attempt 2/30 - Service not ready yet, waiting...
...
‚ùå Service did not become healthy in time
```

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. Added Spring Boot Actuator Dependency

**File:** `pom.xml`

Added:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Configured Actuator Endpoints

**File:** `src/main/resources/application.properties`

Added:
```properties
# Actuator Configuration for Health Checks
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
management.health.defaults.enabled=true
management.endpoint.health.probes.enabled=true
```

### 3. Created Test Script

**File:** `test-actuator.ps1`

Script to verify actuator endpoints are working.

## What to Do Next üöÄ

### Step 1: Rebuild and Deploy

You need to rebuild and redeploy with the new changes:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Users\PC\Desktop\SEM 5 Project\Inventory-Management-System_Grp_16\backend\Orderservice"

# Build the application
.\mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Deploy to VM (manual update)
gcloud compute scp target/Orderservice-*.jar orderservice-vm:/tmp/orderservice.jar --zone=us-central1-a

# SSH and restart service
gcloud compute ssh orderservice-vm --zone=us-central1-a --command="
    sudo mv /tmp/orderservice.jar /opt/orderservice/orderservice.jar &&
    sudo chown orderservice:orderservice /opt/orderservice/orderservice.jar &&
    sudo systemctl restart orderservice &&
    sleep 10 &&
    sudo systemctl status orderservice
"
```

### Step 2: Test the Health Endpoint

```powershell
# Run the test script
.\test-actuator.ps1
```

OR manually test:

```powershell
$VM_IP = gcloud compute instances describe orderservice-vm --zone=us-central1-a --format='get(networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP)'
curl "http://${VM_IP}:8084/actuator/health"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "db": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "database": "MySQL",
        "validationQuery": "isValid()"
      }
    },
    "diskSpace": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "total": 21003583488,
        "free": 15686623232,
        "threshold": 10485760,
        "exists": true
      }
    },
    "ping": {
      "status": "UP"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push Changes

Once you verify it works manually, commit the changes:

```bash
git add pom.xml src/main/resources/application.properties
git commit -m "Add Spring Boot Actuator for health checks"
git push origin main
```

Now the CI/CD pipeline will work correctly!

## Available Actuator Endpoints üìä

After the fix, these endpoints will be available:

### Health Check
```
GET http://YOUR_VM_IP:8084/actuator/health
```
Returns the health status of your application.

### Info
```
GET http://YOUR_VM_IP:8084/actuator/info
```
Returns application information.

### Metrics
```
GET http://YOUR_VM_IP:8084/actuator/metrics
```
Returns various metrics about your application.

## Why This Happened ü§î

The GitHub Actions workflow includes health checks to ensure the deployed service is actually running and responsive. Without Spring Boot Actuator:

1. ‚ùå `/actuator/health` endpoint doesn't exist
2. ‚ùå Health checks fail with 404 Not Found
3. ‚ùå Workflow thinks deployment failed (even though service is running)
4. ‚ùå GitHub Actions marks the deployment as failed

With Spring Boot Actuator:

1. ‚úÖ `/actuator/health` endpoint exists
2. ‚úÖ Health checks succeed with 200 OK
3. ‚úÖ Workflow confirms deployment is successful
4. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions marks the deployment as passed

## Testing Checklist ‚úì

Before pushing to trigger CI/CD:

- [ ] Build locally: `.\mvnw clean package`
- [ ] Manual deploy to VM (see Step 1 above)
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://VM_IP:8084/actuator/health`
- [ ] Verify response shows `"status": "UP"`
- [ ] Test API endpoint: `curl http://VM_IP:8084/api/orders/all`
- [ ] Commit changes to Git
- [ ] Push to main branch
- [ ] Watch GitHub Actions workflow succeed! üéâ

## Future Enhancements üöÄ

Consider adding more actuator endpoints for better monitoring:

```properties
# Add these to application.properties for more insights
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics,prometheus
management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true
```

This enables:
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Custom health indicators
- Application insights
