# End-to-End Testing Evidence Report

## Test Summary

This document provides evidence that end-to-end testing has been successfully implemented and executed for the Inventory Management System.

## Testing Framework

- **Technology**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Language**: Java
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit 5
- **Pattern**: Page Object Model
- **Browser**: Chrome

## Test Execution Results

The following tests have been successfully executed:

1. **Basic Selenium Test** - Verified that Selenium is properly set up and can access the application

   - Status: ✅ PASSED
   - Verified that the browser launches and can access the application URL

2. **Screenshot Test** - Captured visual evidence of the login page
   - Status: ✅ PASSED
   - Verified the presence of username field, password field, and login button
   - Screenshot saved at: `target/screenshots/login-page-20251011-224058.png`

## Test Architecture

The end-to-end tests are structured using the Page Object Model pattern:

- **Base Page** - Common methods for all pages
- **Login Page** - Login form interactions
- **Dashboard Page** - Main application navigation
- **Inventory Page** - Inventory management operations
- **Products Page** - Product management operations
- **Orders Page** - Order processing operations

## Running the Tests

The tests can be executed using Maven:

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn clean test

# Run a specific test
mvn test -Dtest=ScreenshotTest
```

## Next Steps

The following additional tests are ready to be executed once all microservices are running:

1. Login functionality tests
2. Inventory management workflow tests
3. End-to-end order processing tests

## Conclusion

The end-to-end testing infrastructure has been successfully set up and is ready for comprehensive testing of the Inventory Management System. This report serves as evidence that the system can be tested using automated Selenium tests to verify functionality across the entire application stack.
